0) Set the PATH so that a good compiler is used, for instance gcc-4.4

$ which g++
/usr/local/soft/gcc/4.4.0/bin/g++

Make sure your version isn't listed here:
http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#brokengcc

If needed, install cmake (http://www.cmake.org/)

1) Download the tool

TOOL=/where/you/want/
git clone [...] $TOOL

2) Choose a temporary directory to install SystemC and LLVM :

DOWNLOAD=/somewhere/else/

3) Optionnally: install llvm and llvm-gcc. If you do not do so, the
installation script will do it for you (but will take time and disk
space to do the compilation). On a Debian-based system, this should be
as simple as

  aptitude install llvm-dev
  aptitude install llvm-gcc

LLVM's version should be 3.2. Note that the version of LLVM provided
by Debian requires libffi, so you may need to run

  aptitude install libffi-dev

too.

4) Run cmake:

cd $TOOL
cmake -DEXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIR=$DOWNLOAD .

5) Execute the script

cd $TOOL
./install-pinavm.sh

The script may have to install LLVM and llvm-gcc. If it does so, then
the installed tools must be added to your PATH, like:

export PATH=$PATH:$DOWNLOAD/lib/llvm-gcc/bin:$DOWNLOAD/lib/llvm-2.8/bin

You may have to restart ./install-pinavm.sh after setting your PATH.

The script will compile the front-end and back-end. We can now run the
examples.

6) Compile an example

cd $TOOL/systemc-examples/jerome-chain
make

7) Run an example

./main.exe -print-ir -print-elab -b promela -o ok.3.pr main.opt.sc.bc -inline -args 3
